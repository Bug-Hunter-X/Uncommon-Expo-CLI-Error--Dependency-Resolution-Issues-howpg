This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has issues with its package.json file or dependencies.  It's not a specific, easily identifiable error message from Expo itself, but rather a consequence of underlying problems.  The error usually manifests during installation or building processes, indicating that some dependencies cannot be resolved or installed correctly.  It might appear as variations of `ERR! code ELIFECYCLE`, or a different error code entirely related to your node_modules folder problems.
