# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Dependency Resolution Issues

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error is not a specific Expo error message, but rather a consequence of underlying problems with dependency resolution during the installation or build process.  The root cause is often related to inconsistencies or issues within the project's `package.json` file or its dependencies.

## Problem
The error might manifest as variations of `ERR! code ELIFECYCLE` or other dependency-related error codes.  It indicates that npm or yarn cannot successfully install or resolve project dependencies.

## Solution
The solution often involves carefully reviewing the `package.json` file, cleaning the project's cache, and potentially reinstalling dependencies.

## Reproduction Steps (for bug.js):
1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run `expo start` or `expo build:ios` (or android).  The exact command will depend on the setup of the project file.  The result should be the error reported here.

## Solution Steps (for bugSolution.js):
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder.
2. Delete the `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) file.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall the dependencies.
4. Attempt to run `expo start` again.  This will likely resolve the issue.

If the problem persists, consider the following:
* **Check `package.json`:** Ensure that all dependencies are correctly listed and that there are no conflicting versions.
* **Check the versions:** Check for any updates or version mismatches within the dependencies.
* **NPM Cache:** Clear the npm cache using `npm cache clean --force`.
* **Yarn Cache:** If using Yarn, clean the cache using the appropriate Yarn command.
* **Verify network connection:** Check if you have a stable internet connection to ensure that all dependencies can be downloaded correctly.
