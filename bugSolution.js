// This file doesn't contain code to fix the bug directly, 
// because the bug is related to package.json and dependency management.
// The solution lies in the steps described in the README.
// The key is to clean the project, remove node_modules, 
// reinstall dependencies, and possibly investigate package.json for issues.
